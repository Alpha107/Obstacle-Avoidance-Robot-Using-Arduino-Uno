# Obstacle Avoidance Robot Using Arduino Uno

An autonomous robot that detects and avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. This project demonstrates sensor-based navigation and real-time decision-making.

## Introduction
The Obstacle Avoidance Robot is an autonomous vehicle designed to detect obstacles in its path and navigate around them without human intervention. Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance between the robot and nearby objects. The Arduino Uno processes the data and controls the motors to avoid collisions.

This project helps in understanding sensor interfacing, motor control, and real-time decision-making. Obstacle avoidance robots are widely used in autonomous vehicles, service robots, and indoor navigation systems.
